CDVDinfo is a small program that can tell you information's about
your DVD or CDRW drive. The main reason for making this program
was to learn a bit about programming for C++, combined with 
learning something about DVD-drive region protection.

You don't, it's for free.

3. What do I do with the saved file with information about my drive?
You sent the files to this address: cdvdinfo@e-mail.dk
